# Bona Fido
My submission into PlayJam 6! Currently in jammy state, but hopefully in Catalog soon. Can't guarantee any good-practice code in here, but feel free to poke around and take what you want!

A full list of credits and dependencies can be found [here](https://rae.wtf/blog/bona-fido-manual#credits).

If you wanna play this game, it's available for download [here](https://stuffbyrae.itch.io/bona-fido). Or, if you just LOVE command line tools, use `pdc` to build the `source/` folder, and enjoy!
