# Bona Fido
My submission into PlayJam 6! Currently in jammy state, but hopefully in Catalog soon. Can't guarantee any good-practice code in here, but feel free to poke around and take what you want!

A full list of credits and dependencies can be found [here](https://rae.wtf/blog/bona-fido-manual#credits).

If you wanna play this game, it's available for purchase [here](https://play.date/games/bona-fido). Or, if you just LOVE command line tools and HATE paying money for things, use `pdc` to build the `source/` folder, and enjoy! (Note that scoreboard functions won't work properly when building from source â€” for proper leaderboard support, please consider buying the game in Catalog!)
